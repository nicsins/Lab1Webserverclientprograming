<li>Add the&nbsp;class attribute <strong>"section-header"</strong> to each of your section <strong>h2</strong> headers. Write CSS selector and styles to apply a style of your choice to the section headers.</li>
<li>Make the background your favorite color. Hint: apply the style to the <strong>body</strong>&nbsp;element.&nbsp; If desired, change the color of the body text too.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Use CSS to select your <strong>favorite-movie-title</strong>&nbsp;span to by the ID.&nbsp; Use attributes to display the&nbsp;name of the movie in italic text, and a different color to the paragraph text.</li>
<li>Use CSS to select your <strong>favorite-music-artist-name</strong>&nbsp;span by the ID. Display the name of the band in bold text and a different color to the paragraph text.</li>
<li>Use CSS to select your<strong> most-favorite-food</strong> li element. Add a style of your choice to this element.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Use CSS to select your images by the class <strong>favorite-image</strong>.

<li>Apply styles to your table - display the header &lt;th&gt; elements in one color text, and the body &lt;td&gt; elements in a different color. Add a border. &nbsp;</li>
